# Disease Prediction Streamlit App

This is a Streamlit web application designed to predict multiple diseases using machine learning models. The app takes input features related to a patient's health and provides predictions for various diseases based on trained models.

## Features

- Input form for users to enter relevant health information.
- Utilizes machine learning models to predict the likelihood of different diseases.
- Interactive and user-friendly interface powered by Streamlit.
- Easy deployment on Streamlit Sharing.
